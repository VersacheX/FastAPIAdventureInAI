Artifacts intertwine: time gates, Epoch engines, pendants, Masamune blades, Zeal relics. Characters wear vivid detail: Crono sword gleaming, Marle pendant glowing, Lucca goggles flashing, Frog blade polished, Robo frame humming, Ayla showing primal strength, Magus cloak trailing shadows.",

  "story_preface": "Lanterns drift above the festival square, their warm glow washing over celebrations. Near the fountain, Marle leans in with a teasing grin, her pendant scattering light across the water. Sparks jump from Lucca device nearby, drawing cheers. A shift in the air stills the festivities. Lanterns tremble as a ripple of light coils into a time gate at the plaza heart. The crowd freezes as you burst through, tumbling onto the stones. Crono hand tightens on his sword, Marle startles back, Lucca fumbles for her tools. From the edge, Magus steps into view, cloak trailing behind him. Lucca groans about time acting up again. The music stirs back to life as the festival absorbs its newest guest.",
